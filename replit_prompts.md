# Replit Prompts for Building a GCP-Powered Multi-User Chatbot SaaS

Below is a series of step-by-step prompts designed for use with Replit’s AI coding assistant. These prompts will guide you through creating a full-stack multi-user chatbot application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The application will let users upload personal structured data (fitness logs, location history, chat transcripts, music preferences, etc.) and then query that data in natural language. The stack includes a React front-end (with user authentication), a FastAPI back-end (with data ingestion, BigQuery querying, and Vertex AI integration), and various GCP services (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Vertex AI, and optionally Firestore/Secret Manager). Each prompt is written in an actionable way, expecting modular, testable code and proper configuration. All instructions use British English and assume the reader is an experienced developer.

## Project Scaffold and Configuration Prompts

**Goal:** Set up the project structure, authentication, environment variables, and GCP service access in a Replit environment. Ensure the front-end (React) and back-end (FastAPI) are organised cleanly, and prepare the development workflow and cloud configuration.

### Prompt 1: Create Project Structure and Initialise Dependencies

**Description:** Scaffold the project as a monorepo in Replit, with separate folders for front-end and back-end, and a shared utilities folder. Include initial files and package configurations for a React front-end and FastAPI back-end, and install necessary dependencies (`react`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `google-cloud-bigquery`, `google-cloud-vertexai`, `langchain`, etc.).

**Prompt (to Replit AI):** *“Set up a new full-stack project with a React front-end and FastAPI back-end. Create a directory structure with `frontend/`, `backend/`, and `common/` (for shared code). In `frontend/`, initialise a React app (e.g. using Create React App or Vite) with TypeScript if possible. In `backend/`, initialise a Python module with a `main.py` that creates a FastAPI app and a simple health-check endpoint (e.g. GET `/` returns `"OK"`). In `common/`, add a README.md or placeholder file for now. Provide the content of key files: `frontend/package.json` (with dependencies like React, Firebase, etc.), `frontend/src/index.{js,tsx}`, and `backend/main.py` (with minimal FastAPI app code). Also create `backend/requirements.txt` listing necessary Python libraries (e.g. fastapi, uvicorn, google-cloud-bigquery, google-cloud-vertexai, langchain, firebase-admin). After this, ensure the Replit environment is configured to run both front-end and back-end (you can suggest using a Procfile or Replit Nix config to run `npm start` and `uvicorn` concurrently).”*

**Expected Outcome:** Replit should generate the project files: a React app scaffold in the `frontend` directory and a FastAPI app in the `backend` directory. The directory tree should resemble: 

```
project-root/
├── frontend/   (React app with src/, public/, package.json, etc.)
├── backend/    (FastAPI app with main.py, requirements.txt, etc.)
└── common/     (shared utilities, initially empty or with placeholders)
``` 

The `backend/main.py` should create a FastAPI instance and include a simple route to verify it runs. Dependencies should be declared (e.g., in `package.json` for Node and `requirements.txt` for Python). This lays the groundwork for a full-stack app.

### Prompt 2: Implement Front-end User Authentication (Firebase Auth Integration)

**Description:** Add user authentication to the front-end using Firebase Authentication. This prompt will guide setup of Firebase in the React app and creation of a login interface, enabling users to sign in (for example, via Google or email/password). The authentication state will be used to guard the application.

**Prompt:** *“Integrate Firebase Authentication into the React front-end. Install the Firebase JS SDK (`firebase` npm package) and add Firebase config to the project. In `frontend/src/firebase.js` (or a similar file), initialise Firebase with your project’s config and initialise the Auth service ([Get Started with Firebase Authentication on Websites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start#:~:text=import%20,firebase%2Fauth)). Create a simple login component that allows users to sign in – for simplicity, implement Google Sign-In or email/password. For Google Sign-In, enable it in your Firebase project and use `signInWithPopup` with the GoogleAuthProvider. Manage the authenticated state in the React app (perhaps using Context or React state): show the login screen when no user is signed in, and show the chat interface when authenticated. Ensure that after a successful login, you obtain the Firebase ID token (using `user.getIdToken()` from the Firebase Auth API) to use for back-end API calls. Provide the code for the Firebase config initialisation and a basic login UI (a button for Google Sign-In is sufficient).”*

**Expected Outcome:** The React front-end will now include Firebase Auth. The Firebase SDK is configured with the project credentials, and `getAuth()` is initialised ([Get Started with Firebase Authentication on Websites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start#:~:text=import%20,firebase%2Fauth)). A Login component (or page) is implemented, which on click triggers Firebase’s authentication (e.g., Google OAuth popup). After logging in, the user’s JWT ID token can be retrieved for use in API calls. The app state should reflect whether the user is logged in, and conditionally render either a login screen or the main chat interface.

### Prompt 3: Secure Back-end with Firebase ID Token Verification

**Description:** Now that the front-end can authenticate users, the back-end needs to trust those logins. We will use Firebase Admin SDK in the FastAPI back-end to verify incoming Firebase ID tokens on protected endpoints. This ensures only logged-in users can upload data or query the chatbot.

**Prompt:** *“Secure the FastAPI back-end by verifying Firebase Authentication ID tokens on each request. Use the Firebase Admin SDK (`firebase-admin` in Python) to verify tokens ([Verify ID Tokens  |  Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#:~:text=Python)). First, initialise the Firebase Admin app in the back-end (e.g., in `backend/auth.py`), using the service account credentials for your Firebase project (you can download a service account JSON from the Firebase console and add it to Replit Secrets or the file system). For example, load the JSON and call `firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)` ([Bringing Firebase Admin To Python](https://firebase.blog/posts/2017/04/bringing-firebase-admin-to-python/#:~:text=import%20firebase_admin%20from%20firebase_admin%20import,credentials)). Next, create a dependency or middleware in FastAPI that checks for an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header on protected routes. This middleware should call `auth.verify_id_token(id_token)` to decode the token ([Verify ID Tokens  |  Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#:~:text=Python)), and extract the `uid`. If verification fails, return 401 Unauthorized. Apply this security to relevant endpoints (data upload, data query, etc.), but allow public endpoints (like health-check) to skip it. Provide the code for initialising the Firebase Admin SDK and an example FastAPI dependency that enforces authentication by verifying the token and attaching the `user_id` to the request state.”*

**Expected Outcome:** The back-end now requires valid Firebase ID tokens for protected operations. We expect to see code using `firebase_admin` to load credentials and verify tokens. For example, a function or dependency that takes the `Authorization` header, strips the “Bearer” token, and calls `auth.verify_id_token(token)` to get the decoded payload (with the user’s UID) ([Verify ID Tokens  |  Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#:~:text=Python)). If the token is valid, the request proceeds (and the UID can be used to isolate user data); if not, the request is rejected. This ensures only authenticated users’ requests are processed by the API.

### Prompt 4: Configure GCP Service Account and Environment for BigQuery & Vertex AI

**Description:** Enable server-side access to GCP services (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Vertex AI, etc.) by setting up a GCP service account and credentials. We will configure the service account with the necessary IAM roles and load its credentials in the Replit environment securely. This prompt also covers enabling relevant GCP APIs.

**Prompt:** *“Set up Google Cloud credentials and API access in the back-end. Create a GCP Service Account (in your Google Cloud project) with the following roles: BigQuery Data Editor (for querying and managing BigQuery datasets) ([IAM Actions defined by BigQuery - Permissions](https://gcp.permissions.cloud/iam/bigquery#:~:text=IAM%20Actions%20defined%20by%20BigQuery,dataViewer%29%20BigQuery)), BigQuery Job User, Storage Object Admin (if using Cloud Storage for file uploads), and Vertex AI User (for calling Vertex AI generative models). If using Firestore for metadata, also add Firestore User or Owner role. Download the JSON key for this service account. In Replit, add this JSON as a secret file or set an environment secret `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointing to the JSON file path. Also set an env var for `GCP_PROJECT` with your GCP project ID. Install Google Cloud Python libraries (`google-cloud-bigquery`, `google-cloud-storage`, `google-cloud-aiplatform` or the newer `google-cloud-vertexai`). In `backend/main.py` (or a startup script), initialise the GCP clients using Application Default Credentials ([Create a dataset in BigQuery.  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-create-dataset#:~:text=from%20google)). For example, use `bigquery.Client()` to initialise a BigQuery client (it will pick up the credentials from the environment) ([Create a dataset in BigQuery.  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-create-dataset#:~:text=from%20google)). Do the same for Vertex AI if using a SDK (e.g., `from google.cloud import aiplatform; aiplatform.init(project=..., location="us-central1")`). Confirm connectivity by writing a small test: on startup, list the BigQuery datasets in the project or call a simple BigQuery SQL via `client.query("SELECT 1")`. Provide the code that initialises the BigQuery client and (optionally) a Vertex AI client, ensuring they use the service account credentials.”*

**Expected Outcome:** The back-end is now authenticated with GCP. We expect to see environment variable usage or credential loading code. For example, `os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]` is set to the path of the service account JSON (Replit secrets store this securely) ([Replit Docs](https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets#:~:text=Secrets%20are%20encrypted%20variables%20you,them%20directly%20in%20your%20code)). The code uses `bigquery.Client()` which under the hood uses the ADC (Application Default Credentials) provided by that service account ([Create a dataset in BigQuery.  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-create-dataset#:~:text=from%20google)). The service account has appropriate IAM roles, so BigQuery and Vertex calls will succeed. The BigQuery client test (listing datasets or executing a trivial query) should run without permission errors. By this step, all necessary GCP APIs (BigQuery, Vertex AI, etc.) should be enabled in the project, and the service account is the bridge between our app and GCP services.

### Prompt 5: Set Up Replit Development Workflow and Plan for Deployment

**Description:** Optimise the development environment and prepare for eventual deployment on Google Cloud. Ensure that both front-end and back-end can run simultaneously in Replit for testing, and outline steps to deploy the app to the cloud (e.g., using Cloud Run or Firebase Hosting).

**Prompt:** *“Configure the Replit development workflow so that you can run the React front-end and FastAPI back-end concurrently. In Replit, you can use a Procfile or the Replit GUI to run multiple processes. For example, define a Procfile with:
```
frontend: npm --prefix frontend start
backend: uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
``` 
This will start the React dev server (on e.g. port 3000) and the FastAPI server on port 8000. Adjust Replit’s run configuration to use this Procfile. Verify that you can access the front-end UI and that it can communicate with the back-end (you might configure proxy in React or use full URLs to the backend). Next, outline the steps for deploying this app to production on GCP. Suggest using **Cloud Run** for the FastAPI back-end (containerise the Python app with its requirements) and using **Firebase Hosting** or a static site bucket for the React front-end. Note that in production, environment secrets (like service account creds) should be stored securely – on Cloud Run, use Secrets Manager or set environment variables in the service config (do not bake secrets into the image). Provide any necessary configuration changes (like CORS settings on FastAPI to allow the deployed front-end domain, etc.). The output should be a brief guide within the prompt for how to deploy, not the full deployment code. Also ensure to mention adjusting any OAuth redirect URIs in Firebase Auth if the domain changes.”*

**Expected Outcome:** The Replit environment is configured for easy development and testing: both front-end and back-end run together, allowing for end-to-end testing of login and API calls. We should have a Procfile or equivalent multi-run configuration. Additionally, the prompt’s instructions prepare the developer for deployment: it mentions using Cloud Run for the back-end and possibly Firebase Hosting for the front-end, using GCP’s built-in capabilities. While not executed by Replit, these instructions ensure the developer considers production aspects (such as secret management with GCP Secret Manager and configuring Firebase Auth domains). At this stage, the project setup and configuration is complete, and we can move to building specific features component by component.

## Component-by-Component Build Prompts

**Goal:** Implement the major features of the application step by step. This includes the chat UI on the front-end, data ingestion and schema management on the back-end, the query planning logic using LLM (LangChain/Vertex), and final answer generation. Each prompt focuses on a specific component or functionality, resulting in modular code.

### Prompt 6: Build Chatbot UI (Chat Window and Message Handling in React)

**Description:** Create the chat interface on the front-end. This involves a secure chat window where the user can input questions and see responses, as well as possibly a list of past queries. The UI should use the authentication state (only accessible when logged in) and send queries to the back-end API.

**Prompt:** *“Implement the chatbot UI in the React front-end. Create a component (e.g. `Chatbot.jsx` or `ChatWindow.tsx`) that displays a chat history and an input box for the user’s question. Use React state to maintain an array of message objects (with fields like `sender` = 'user' or 'bot', `text`, and maybe a timestamp). When the user submits a question, append it to the chat history (optimistically as a user message) and call the back-end query API (e.g. a POST request to `/api/query` endpoint) including the Firebase ID token in the header for authentication. While waiting for the reply, you can show a loading indicator. Once the response is received, add it to the chat history as a bot message. Ensure the UI is styled for clarity – you can use simple CSS for chat bubbles or a library if preferred. Also handle errors (e.g. if the API returns an error, show an error message to the user and allow them to retry). Provide the React code for the chat component, including the state logic and the function making the API call (use `fetch` or Axios). The component should be integrated into the main app (e.g. rendered in `App.jsx` when the user is logged in).”*

**Expected Outcome:** The React front-end now has a functional chat interface. The user can type a question and send it. The component will send the query to the back-end (with proper auth header). For now, the back-end endpoint might not be fully implemented, but this front-end will be ready to display whatever response it receives. The code should be modular (perhaps the fetch logic could be in a separate hook or utility, but in an answer we likely see it inline). The UI should update reactively: immediately showing the user’s query in the chat log, and then later the answer from the bot. This sets the stage to connect the front-end with the intelligent back-end.

### Prompt 7: Implement Data Upload Endpoint and Ingestion Logic (BigQuery Integration)

**Description:** Allow users to upload their structured data via the back-end. We need a FastAPI endpoint that accepts file uploads (CSV or JSON), processes the file, and loads the data into BigQuery under the user’s own dataset. A helper function will handle inspecting the file schema and performing the BigQuery upload.

**Prompt:** *“Create a FastAPI endpoint to handle data uploads and ingest data into BigQuery. In `backend/main.py` (or a dedicated router, e.g. `routers/data.py`), add a POST endpoint `/data/upload` that expects a file (CSV or JSON) and a `dataset_name` (string) as form data. Use `fastapi.UploadFile` for the file input. The endpoint should be protected by the authentication dependency (only accessible with a valid Firebase token, from which you can get `user_id`). When a file is uploaded, the backend should:
  1. Read the file into memory (if CSV, you can use pandas or Python CSV to parse; if JSON, parse it accordingly).
  2. Inspect the data schema: determine column names and data types. (For now, you can derive this from pandas DataFrame dtypes or by reading the first few rows.)
  3. Create a BigQuery dataset for the user if it doesn’t exist. For example, dataset ID could be `user_<uid>` or use the Firebase UID directly. Use the BigQuery client to create the dataset (use `client.create_dataset()` with the project and dataset id) ([Create a dataset in BigQuery.  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-create-dataset#:~:text=,US)).
  4. Create a BigQuery table within that dataset corresponding to the uploaded data. Table name can be based on `dataset_name` provided (e.g., "fitness" or "location"). Use BigQuery’s Python client to load data. E.g., if you used pandas, convert DataFrame to BigQuery by `client.load_table_from_dataframe(df, table_id)` ([Load data from DataFrame  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-load-table-dataframe#:~:text=job%20%3D%20client,for%20the%20job%20to%20complete)), or stream the file. Ensure that the job completes successfully before returning.
  5. Return a success response with some metadata, e.g. number of rows added and table name.

Make sure to handle errors: if the file is not valid or BigQuery fails, return an appropriate error response. Also, limit file size for safety (you can enforce a maximum number of rows or file size). Provide the code for the ingestion helper function (e.g. `ingest_file_to_bigquery(user_id, dataset_name, file_contents)`) as well as the FastAPI endpoint that uses it. The helper should be modular enough to be tested independently (for instance, given a DataFrame and target table, it can create or append to that table).”*

**Expected Outcome:** A new API endpoint `/data/upload` exists in the FastAPI backend. The prompt’s code will show the use of `UploadFile` to receive a file, creation of a BigQuery dataset for the user (if not already created) ([Create a dataset in BigQuery.  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-create-dataset#:~:text=,format%28client.project%2C%20dataset.dataset_id)), and loading the file’s content into a BigQuery table. For example, if the user uploads a file for “fitness” data, after this call, we expect a BigQuery dataset named e.g. `user_abc123` (where abc123 is the UID) and inside it a table named “fitness” containing the uploaded records. The code likely uses `pandas.read_csv()` if CSV, and then `client.load_table_from_dataframe` to push to BigQuery, leveraging Google’s BigQuery client library to infer schema and load data ([Load data from DataFrame  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-load-table-dataframe#:~:text=job%20%3D%20client,for%20the%20job%20to%20complete)). The response might include `{"status":"success","rows":1234,"table":"project.user_abc123.fitness"}` or similar. This sets up the pipeline for storing user data in BigQuery for later querying.

### Prompt 8: Develop a Metadata Schema Registry for User Data

**Description:** After ingesting data, it’s important to keep track of what data each user has and the schema of each dataset. We will implement a registry that maps each user’s dataset names to BigQuery table IDs and schema details. This can be stored in BigQuery (a metadata table) or Firestore.

**Prompt:** *“Implement a schema metadata registry to keep track of user datasets and their schema. After a user uploads data (from the previous step), record the metadata. We can approach this in two ways: (a) use Firestore, or (b) use a BigQuery table as a registry. For now, implement option (b) for simplicity. Create a BigQuery dataset (if not already) for metadata, e.g. `metadata_registry`, and a table `datasets` with columns: user_id (STRING), dataset_name (STRING), table_project (STRING), table_dataset (STRING), table_name (STRING), schema (STRING or JSON). Each time data is uploaded, upsert a record into `metadata_registry.datasets` for that user and dataset. The schema can be stored as a JSON string listing fields. Provide a Python function `register_dataset_metadata(user_id, dataset_name, table_id, schema_fields)` that inserts or updates this info in the BigQuery metadata table. Use BigQuery’s Python API to perform an UPSERT (since BigQuery doesn’t natively upsert easily, you can do a delete + insert, or use MERGE in a SQL query via `client.query`). Ensure this runs after a successful data ingestion. Additionally, implement a GET endpoint `/data/list` in FastAPI that, for an authenticated user, queries the metadata table (or Firestore if that was chosen) and returns a list of datasets they have along with schema info. This allows the front-end (or the back-end’s query planning) to know what data is available. If using Firestore instead, outline how you would store a document per user with subcollection of datasets. Provide the code for the `register_dataset_metadata` function and the `/data/list` endpoint using BigQuery as the metadata store.”*

**Expected Outcome:** The back-end now keeps a record of each user’s datasets and schema. The code will show a `register_dataset_metadata` function that likely uses the BigQuery client to insert a row into a table. It might convert the schema (list of BigQuery SchemaField objects or pandas dtypes) into a JSON string to store. For example, after uploading “fitness” data with columns ["date", "steps", "calories"], the metadata table will have a row: `user_id = abc123, dataset_name = "fitness", table_project = "<GCP_PROJECT>", table_dataset = "user_abc123", table_name = "fitness", schema = "[{'name': 'date', 'type': 'DATE'}, {'name': 'steps', 'type': 'INTEGER'}, ...]"`. The GET `/data/list` endpoint will retrieve all entries for the current user (by filtering on user_id) and return them, so the front-end could display the list of datasets or use it for verification. This registry will also be crucial for the query planning step, as the LLM needs to know what data (which tables/fields) the user has.

### Prompt 9: Create Query Planning Logic (LLM Prompt to SQL Generation)

**Description:** Implement the core logic that takes a natural language question and produces a BigQuery SQL query to answer it. We will use an LLM (via Vertex AI or LangChain) to interpret the question against the known schemas and craft an appropriate SQL. The focus is on transforming the user’s query into a correct SQL statement, possibly using LangChain’s capabilities for text-to-SQL.

**Prompt:** *“Implement the query planning component that converts a user’s natural language question into a SQL query for BigQuery. Using the metadata registry, gather the user’s available datasets and their schemas. For instance, compile a list of tables and fields the user has, in a prompt-friendly format (e.g., “You have the following tables: Fitness(date, steps, calories), Location(timestamp, latitude, longitude), ...”). We will use a Large Language Model to generate SQL. You can use **LangChain** for this, or call Vertex AI’s model with a custom prompt. For an initial approach, use LangChain’s SQL capabilities: establish a connection to the user’s BigQuery dataset. LangChain has a `SQLDatabase` utility and an agent that can create SQL ([SQL Agent for Google Big Query · Issue #17762 · langchain-ai/langchain · GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/17762#:~:text=Yes%2C%20it%20is%20indeed%20possible,and%20a%20toolkit%20or%20database)). For example, use `SQLDatabase.from_uri("bigquery://<ProjectID>/<Dataset>")` to connect to the user’s dataset, and then use an LLM chain or `create_sql_agent` with that database ([SQL Agent for Google Big Query · Issue #17762 · langchain-ai/langchain · GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/17762#:~:text=from%20langchain_openai%20import%20ChatOpenAI%20from,utilities%20import%20SQLDatabase)). (If using Vertex AI via LangChain, ensure the Vertex LLM is configured as the language model; alternatively, use OpenAI’s GPT-3.5/4 as the LLM for now if that’s easier, knowing you can swap to Vertex later ([SQL Agent for Google Big Query · Issue #17762 · langchain-ai/langchain · GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/17762#:~:text=from%20langchain_openai%20import%20ChatOpenAI%20from,utilities%20import%20SQLDatabase)).) 

Write a function `plan_query(user_id: str, question: str) -> str` that implements this. It should:
  - Retrieve the list of tables and schemas for the user (from the metadata registry).
  - Construct or use a prompt for the LLM that includes the schemas and the natural language question, asking for a SQL query. (If using LangChain’s agent, this is handled internally, but ensure the agent is provided the schema context.)
  - Call the LLM to get a response (the SQL query). If using LangChain’s `SQLDatabaseChain` or agent, you might simply provide the question and get back an answer which includes the SQL executed. If you want more control, you can prompt something like: “Given the following tables and schemas: ... and the question: ... , write a BigQuery Standard SQL query that answers the question.” 
  - Return the generated SQL query as a string.

Make sure to handle cases where the question might refer to a dataset that doesn’t exist or is ambiguous. In such cases, the LLM/agent should ideally respond that it’s not sure, or you might handle it by validating the SQL against known tables. Also, for multi-step reasoning or verification: you could run the generated SQL on BigQuery in a dry run to see if it’s valid, and if it fails, potentially iterate (this could be an advanced step where you catch errors and re-prompt the LLM with the error message to refine the query). For now, implement the basic happy-path: question -> SQL. Provide the code for the `plan_query` function, showing how you integrate with LangChain or the LLM to get the SQL. Include an example in comments, e.g., question: “How many steps did I walk last week?” -> SQL: `SELECT SUM(steps) FROM user_<uid>.fitness WHERE date BETWEEN ...`. Ensure the function is modular (it shouldn’t execute the query, just plan it).”*

**Expected Outcome:** We now have a function that uses AI to produce SQL from natural language. The solution likely uses LangChain’s SQLDatabaseChain or an agent with the BigQuery connection. For example, the code might instantiate something like: 

```python
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(f"bigquery://{PROJECT_ID}/{user_dataset}")
llm = VertexAI(...)  # or OpenAI() depending on integration
agent = create_sql_agent(llm, db=db, verbose=True)
sql_query = agent.run(question)
```

as hinted by LangChain docs ([SQL Agent for Google Big Query · Issue #17762 · langchain-ai/langchain · GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/17762#:~:text=Yes%2C%20it%20is%20indeed%20possible,and%20a%20toolkit%20or%20database)) ([SQL Agent for Google Big Query · Issue #17762 · langchain-ai/langchain · GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/17762#:~:text=from%20langchain_openai%20import%20ChatOpenAI%20from,utilities%20import%20SQLDatabase)). Alternatively, a custom prompt via Vertex AI could be used. In either case, `plan_query` returns a SQL string (or potentially the agent might execute and return results; but we want just the SQL for now). This step sets up the brain of the chatbot – the ability to translate English questions into data queries.

### Prompt 10: Execute Query and Compose Answer using Vertex AI (LLM Answer Composition)

**Description:** With the SQL query from the previous step, run it on BigQuery to get results, then use an LLM to generate a user-friendly answer. This step ties everything together: the back-end will accept a question, use `plan_query` to get SQL, fetch data, and then produce a conversational answer via Vertex AI (e.g., PaLM 2 or Gemini model).

**Prompt:** *“Complete the query handling pipeline by executing the planned SQL and then composing a natural language answer. Implement an API endpoint `/query` in FastAPI that accepts a question (and maybe conversation context) from the front-end. The flow should be:
  1. The endpoint (POST `/query`) receives JSON with the question text. It uses the auth dependency to get `user_id`.
  2. Call the `plan_query(user_id, question)` function to get a SQL query for BigQuery.
  3. Execute the SQL on BigQuery using the BigQuery client. Use `client.query(sql)` and retrieve the results. You can get results as a list of rows or a Pandas DataFrame. Limit the results if necessary (for example, don’t retrieve more than a certain number of rows to avoid huge payloads).
  4. Take the query results and feed them into a Vertex AI text generation model to formulate an answer. Use the Vertex AI SDK (`google-cloud-vertexai` or `google.generativeai`) to call a model like PaLM 2 or Gemini. For instance, initialise the Vertex AI GenAI client and call `generate_content` with a prompt that includes the user’s question and a summary of the data results ([Quickstart: Generate text using the Vertex AI Gemini API  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#:~:text=from%20google%20import%20genai%20from,types%20import%20HttpOptions)). For example: 
     Prompt to model: “Q: {user_question}\nData:\n{results_in_some_format}\nAnswer in a concise, helpful way:”
     The model should then produce an answer sentence or paragraph.
  5. Return the answer text to the front-end.

Also consider conversation memory: if the chatbot is having a multi-turn dialogue, you might want to include the last few Q&A pairs in the prompt for context. You can maintain this in the session (perhaps via a simple in-memory store or by requiring the client to send the recent history). LangChain’s memory utilities could help, but you can also do it manually by appending previous interactions to the prompt. Make sure the prompt to Vertex respects token limits by not including too much history or data.

Provide the code for the `/query` endpoint implementation in FastAPI. Show how you initialise the Vertex AI model client (for example, using `vertexai.Client()` or `aiplatform` – ensure the service account has permission). For example, using the `google.genai` library: 
```python
from google import genai
client = genai.Client(credentials=..., project_id=..., location="us-central1")
response = client.models.generate_content(model="text-bison-001", contents=prompt)
answer = response.text
```

Use the model’s response as the answer. Finally, return the answer (and possibly the SQL or data if you want to display it, but primarily the answer text).”*

**Expected Outcome:** The back-end now has a complete `/query` endpoint that ties the components together. When called, it will verify the user, generate a SQL query from their question, run it on BigQuery, and then use a Vertex AI LLM to answer based on the results. The code should demonstrate making a call to Vertex AI’s generative model API with the data. For example, one might see something like:

```python
result_df = bq_client.query(sql_query).to_dataframe()
data_summary = result_df.to_csv(index=False)[:1000]  # summary or partial data
prompt = f"Question: {question}\nHere is the data:\n{data_summary}\nAnswer concisely:"
vertex_client = genai.Client(...)
response = vertex_client.models.generate_content(model="gemini-2.0-chat", contents=prompt)
answer_text = response.text
```

This answer text is then returned as JSON to the front-end. The conversation memory could be handled by storing `recent_qna = []` in a global dict keyed by user, and appending to it each time; then prepending that to the prompt for context on subsequent questions. If implemented, the prompt code would reflect that.

At this stage, the application is end-to-end functional: a user can log in, upload data, ask questions, and get answers. Each answer is backed by a BigQuery query and refined by a large language model for clarity.

### Prompt 11: (Optional) Testing and Refinement

**Description:** It’s important to test the components to ensure they work correctly and efficiently. This prompt encourages writing some tests or performing sample queries to validate the system, and to refine any issues (like SQL injection, error handling, performance concerns).

**Prompt:** *“Now that all components are implemented, let’s test and refine. Write a few unit tests or simple checks for critical functions:
  - Test that `plan_query` returns a plausible SQL string for a given question and known schema (you can simulate a known schema in a test without calling the LLM by monkey-patching the LLM output for predictability).
  - Test that `register_dataset_metadata` correctly inserts a metadata entry (perhaps by calling it and then querying the metadata table or using a mock BigQuery client).
  - If possible, test the `/query` endpoint with a sample question by mocking `plan_query` to return a known SQL and mocking BigQuery client to return a small DataFrame, and then check that the Vertex AI is called. (Full integration test might be complex, but you can test parts of it.)
  
Also, manually run through a scenario:
  1. Simulate a user (with a specific UID) uploading a small CSV of known data.
  2. Then call the `/query` endpoint with a relevant question.
  3. Print out the SQL that was generated and the final answer.

Examine the SQL for correctness and the answer for coherence. If the SQL is incorrect or the answer seems off, consider refining the prompt given to the LLM. For example, if the LLM sometimes misunderstands, you might need to provide more schema info or constraints in the prompt (like telling it not to hallucinate fields). If BigQuery returns an error (e.g., syntax error), catch that and feed it back to the LLM for a second attempt: implement a simple retry logic in `plan_query` where if `client.query` fails, take the error message and ask the LLM “The query failed with error X. Please correct the SQL.” and try again.

Finally, review performance considerations: BigQuery is fast but for very large tables, queries might be slow or expensive – consider adding limits or summarisation (the LLM can always summarise large results). And ensure privacy: each user’s data stays in their own dataset and cannot be accessed by others, enforced by using their UID in dataset names and query filtering.

Document these test results and any tweaks. You don’t need to provide code for tests in this prompt (unless writing an actual test function), but describe any changes you would make to improve reliability.”*

**Expected Outcome:** While this prompt is more descriptive and for validation, it ensures the developer thinks through verification. In practice, one might add print statements or logs in the code to see the intermediate SQL and answers. We expect mention of how `plan_query` can be tested (perhaps by injecting a dummy LLM that returns a fixed SQL). We also expect mention of how errors are handled – e.g., if the LLM produces invalid SQL, the system should handle it gracefully (maybe via a second attempt with feedback). By following this, the final application will be robust and ready for use.

Each of these prompts, when executed in order, guides the development of the multi-user SaaS chatbot application. Using Replit’s AI assistant with these prompts, a developer can iteratively build and refine the system. The end result is a full-stack application where users can securely upload their personal data and query it in natural language, powered by BigQuery for data and Vertex AI for language intelligence.
